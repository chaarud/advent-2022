Notes/caveats (started on day 13):

- Day 11, Part 2: I had to look on reddit for the "trick" to keep the worry values from overflowing
- Day 13, Part 1: This was really a pain, both parsing the input and deciding the ordering. The input parsing alone took 
    me much longer than any other day so far, and the ordering had one subtle bug that I could only find by comparing 
    my solution's results to a working solution's results
